He said we can allocate each rank (say 0-4) as seperate arrays using malloc. 
During their update, the "ghost" cells need to get the info from the other ones.

-set a convergence step, but you CAN set a max number of steps

Make sure each rank sends and recives from the correct ones BEFORE moving on to the next iteration

example

rank0
send rank1
send rank2
recv rank1
rec rank2

Rank1
rec rank 0
rev rank 3
send rank 0
send rank 3

rank2
send rank0
send rank3
recv rank0
recv rank3


rank3
send rank2
send rank1
recv rank2
recv rank1
