### Projects List
This contains projects the are related to distributed, parallel, and high performance computing. 

### Page Rank
 PageRank was a project done in my distributed computing class. Due to this being an assignment, it is on Gitlab in a private directory. <br/>
Used: OpenMP <br/>
Project Code: [Conway 3D](https://github.com/RobSap/Parallel_Programming/tree/master/page_rank)

#### Conway's Game of Life 3D
This was done as a group project. This is the classic Conway's Game of Life, but in 3D. This project uses openGL to display the various objects. The classic glider and explosion are both able to run. This program was written in C++ and uses openMP, openACC and CUDA. There are two versions, the first for visual, and the second for timings based on implentations. <br/>
Used: OpenACC, CUDA, OpenMP <br/>
Project Code: [Conway 3D](https://gitlab.com/rsapping/parallel_project_conway_3d)

#### Parallel K-Means
This is was done as a group project. This is a parallel k-means, implemented in C++,  OpenACC, MPI, OpenMP and a hybrid of openMP with MPI. We tested on three data sets with varrying sizes from small to large: Iris, Frogs, and household_power_consumption. <br/>
Used: OpenACC, CUDA, OpenMP, MPI <br/>
Project Code Gitlab: [Parallel K-means](https://gitlab.com/rsapping/group2_project_kmeans)
Project Code Github: [Parallel K-means](https://github.com/RobSap/Parallel_Programming/tree/master/group_project_parallel_k_means)


#### Parallel Image Manipuator
This is a parallel image manipulation system. It is used to test various implemations of paralle programming, and timings.  <br/>
 Project Code: Not Linked. <br/>
 

#### LabAssignment 1
Using ISPC Compiler from Intel. I did the twirl implementation in serial and parallel. I also include a grayscale implementation, but it currently is commented out. <br/>
Used: ISPC <br/>
Project Code: [Swirl](https://github.com/RobSap/Parallel_Programming/tree/master/LabAssignment1)

#### LabAssignment 2
Using ICC and TBB from Intel, this does a swirl implementation. <br/>
Used: TBB <br/>
Project Code: [Swirl](https://github.com/RobSap/Parallel_Programming/tree/master/LabAssignment2)


#### LabAssignment 3
Fread in text file, change inputs. This is a image from integer format. <br/>
Used: OpenMP <br/>
Project Code: [Parallel CPU](https://github.com/RobSap/Parallel_Programming/tree/master/LabAssignment3)


#### LabAssignment 4
This projects demenstrates the Ghost cells idea. <br/>
Used: MPI <br/>
Project Code: [Ghost Cells](https://github.com/RobSap/Parallel_Programming/tree/master/LabAssignment4)
