### Projects List
This contains projects the are related to distributed, parallel, and high performance computing. 

#### Conway's Game of Life 3D
This was done as a group project. This is the classic Conway's Game of Life, but in 3D. This project uses openGL to display the various objects. The classic glider and explosion are both able to run. This program was written in C++ and uses openMP, openACC and CUDA. There are two versions, the first for visual, and the second for timings based on implentations.

#### Parallel K-Means
This is was done as a group project. This is a parallel k-means, implemented in C++,  openACC, MPI, OpenMP and a hybrid of openMP with MPI. We tested on three data sets with varrying sizes from small to large: Iris, Frogs, and household_power_consumption.

#### Parallel Image Manipuator
This is a paralle image manipulation system. It is used to test various implemations of paralle programming, and timings. </p>
 Project Code: Not Linked.
